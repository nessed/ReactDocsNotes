React
```
function App() {
  const state = true 
  return (
    <div className="App bg-blue-500 h-">
    { state ? (
      <div> Hello </div>
    ) :(
      <div> Bye </div>
    )}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```
1. Javascript like definition of variables should be done before the return statement, as after the return statement only html can be used
This is to conditionally render something in react using ternary operators. 
We need to use curly brackets to enable the use of javascript so the full code will be under the brackets
state ? says 'if state is true then
: says 'else' do this
each statement has its own bracket

When you donâ€™t need the else branch, you can also use a shorter logical && syntax:
This basically states that if isloggedin is true then return adminPanel component otherwise dont return anything
```
<div>
  {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}
</div>
```

```
  const products = [
    {title:'cabbage', id:1},
    {title:'garlic', id:2},
    {title:'apple',id:3}
  ];
  
  const listItems = products.map(product => 
    <li key={product.id}>
      {product.title}
    </li>
  );
```
to use map, 1) Define a const, run map through products in a new variable called product, arrow function it to open a list with a key of the new variable and id, close tag and then open product. title
